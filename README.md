## Panchaboothams

Panchabhoothams are the five elements of nature which are **"Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Akash"**

These elements are termed as **"Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, Wood"**

- As Panchabootas are the building blocks of universe, 
the same Panchabootas are the building blocks of human body too.
- Even for all types of medicine, the same applies be it any kind of medicine like siddha, ayurvedha or alopathy.
- If anyone of panchaboota is lower or higher, the body will malfunction and result in diseases or other impacts on the body ranging form small uncomfortability to serious diseases.
- By nature, our body is capable of healing itself or balancing panchabootas automatically if rest is given to body.
- For example, when a patient is admitted to hospital he/she will be given saline and put them to sleep or rest to observe for some time. This method will help body to fight and balance all the elements to regain the actual state of body.

#### Panchaboota evolution per acupuncture

Being fire is a source, it will create earth
then earth will create metal which will agin create water which then creates wood, it again creates fire.

The same is represented as:
fire -> earth -> metal -> water -> wood

- uzing means panchabhootams
- zing means parimana valarchi that is changing from one state to another

#### Panchaboothams and Relations

- As fire created earth, fire becoes mother and earth becomes son
- As earth created metal, earth becoes mother and metal becomes son
- As metal created water, metal becoes mother and water becomes son
- As water created wood, water becoes mother and wood becomes son
- As wood created fire, wood becoes mother and fire becomes son

It is pcturized as follows:

| Bhootams | mother | son |
|---|---|---|
| Fire | wood | earth |
| Earth | Fire | Metal |
| Metal | Earth | Water |
| Water | Metal | Wood |
| Wood | Water | Fire |

#### Sakthi

Yin, Yang (sivam, sakthi)

Yin is form of masculine energy like day, hot, hard, expressive, bold
Yang is a form of feminine energy like night, cold, calm & confined, soft

In every aspect, there is a yin and yang.
- If there is a yin, then there is a yang too.
- If there is a yang, then there is a yin.

Both are interconnected like arthanaageswarar.
However, the strength or power of it matters, the conditions can be as follows:
- If Yin may be high but yang will be low
- If Yang may be high but yin will be low
- There is possible both of them are present in equal propotion
